abstract = {The control and path planning of multiple drones in a 3D space with obstacle avoidance is a complex challenge, subject to ongoing research. In this paper we propose an optimal control approach, with a baseline controller and filter running on the drones, and a prediction based optimization algorithm running remotely, as a supervisory controller. The supervisor is responsible for calculating the minimal deviation from the trajectory given by the baseline controllers, such that the obstacle is avoided. The approach is tested in simulations with nonlinear drone models in a realistic setting with noise and transmission delays.}
